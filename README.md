## 👋 Hello!

I’m **Sinem Burcu Kara**, a **Computer Engineering graduate** from Ahi Evran University.  
Since my very first year at university, I have been passionate about **game development** and have continuously worked on improving my skills in this field.  

📌 Throughout this journey, I have participated in various events and teams, developing multiple projects and gaining practical experience in game development.  

I am always eager to learn and improve myself.  
🎯 My goal is to deliver not only **fun** but also **technically strong** and **innovative** gaming experiences.
